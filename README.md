## Game Features

### Stage-Based Progression

- Each stage consists of 10 rounds
- As players advance to higher stages:
  - Items appear for less time (decreases by 0.1 seconds per stage, minimum 0.3 seconds)
  - Points per correct answer increase (base 10 points + stage multiplier)
- UI shows current stage, round, and a progress indicator

### 3D Cube Interface

The game features an innovative 3D cube interface where:

- Each face of the cube shows a different question (shape, color, special characteristic)
- One face shows the current score
- Players rotate the cube to answer each question
- This makes the question section visually engaging and interactive
